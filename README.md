Quantum Tic-Tac-Toe is a fun and challenging variant of tic-tac-toe,
where players alternate in placing 2 pieces on a grid per turn. A grid
cell may contain more than 1 piece.

We generalized the game, devised a graph theoretic algorithm to
efficiently implement the game, and analyzed the game's complexity
and it's result in random play and perfect play situations.
We presented our findings at the Intel International Science and
Engineering Fair 2012, and were lucky enough to win a 2nd grand award!

Here are all the codes we wrote for our research.
